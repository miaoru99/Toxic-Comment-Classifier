"""Crazy how someone lost his life for a 20 dollar bill."" Meanwhile, the FED printed Trillions in a few weeks. Nobody stepped on their neck!
Edited : Okay, so first and foremost I hope those people gonna get what they deserve. That was an abuse of power! 
Second: The FED just as any other central banks are creating money outta thin air. It's not backed by any hard asset or anything whatsoever! 1 Trillion dollars is just 13 keystrokes on a computer, nothing else! This is the FIAT monetary system. By creating additional money supply  they are increasing the amount of money(M1,M2) circulating in the system. By definition this is inflation. If they would stop their won't be inflation or asset price inflation. Like doubling housing prices. Now you have to work 20 years more to buy the same apartment that you could have bought 10 years ago for half the price. Proof of money printing? Go to the Federal Reserve's website. Check their balance sheet. All central banks are doing the same. What I meant to say with this is that is very awkward that people want to defend something what only a selected few individuals can do to the benefit of their shareholders because those dollars are created into existence with interest! So you people have to pay interest on the newly printed dollars to the FED which is a private bank with private owners that actually nobody knows. It is not federal! The main thing is that we are all going to witness a great reset. Debt will never be paid back. Maybe inflated into nothing and we savers are going to suffer from it!",0.36,0.0,0.06,0.0,0.1,0.01

I know there are some good cops out there but my whole life i have always hated cops and have never been able to respect them. I have served time in the military and can tell you that the training cops get is a joke they have no idea how to handle many situations. I try hard not to have any hate inside me but i cant help but to look at a cop and feel this way. Police officers are trained so poorly that if i was in need of help at my home the last thing i would do is call a police officer. Most likely the cop would get to my house and probably end up killing me on accident or on purpose. Watching this video infuriated me so much. I honestly feel there are much more bad cops than there are good ones and the good cops have to fall in line with the corrupt officers or they lose their job or worse get killed for trying to be a honest cop.,0.96,0.01,0.16,0.0,0.25,0.02

"the report said he had meth and fentanyl in his system, i have personally seen people high on meth, they stumble around and can barley walk, once he was taken to the squad car he fell, probably because the drugs in his system were taking affect, they moved him from one side of the car to the other, when you try to restrain someone on meth, they become angry and combative, they then pulled him out because he would not calm down, then they held him down attempting to hold him still, but they used a choke like hold on him, the drugs he was on were already messing the with flow of oxygen to his brain, and the additional strain of the hold was too much and he died.  I realize this hold should not have been used, but the knee hold alone should not have killed him, he had harmful drugs in his system and possibly a bad heart when this happened, like when police use a taser to subdue someone it is suppose to knock someone out but if you have a bad heart it has been fatal at times.

"As an Australian, I could never imagine this. I know I have the privilege as a white person, so don't know the experience of first nations people here in Aus, but it shocks me how scared he is of the police. How I interpret it is that (after reading the transcript released today) he is terrified of being shot and killed by the cops so of course, he doesn't want to go with them. Whatever he'd allegedly done, that is no reason for the death sentence he was given. I could never imagine this occurring in my country (again, I only have the experience as a white woman here in Aus). One big factor I see is that cops are scared of people having guns, so they operate intensely, even when there may be no justification for it. Also, it seems these officers have no idea how to deal with mental illness or drug inebriated cases. From my perspective in Aus, looking at a country that most of the time we take leadership points from, America has lost all sense of reason, morality and common sense.",0.47,0.0,0.07,0.0,0.11,0.01

Is there anyone in law enforcement who can explain why George Floyd or any suspect who is handcuffed and in the back of a squad car (which is caged) why they would remove this suspect of such a secured situation?  I know that they called for an ambulance and that the original 911 call was both saying that he maybe intoxicated and that he may have used a counterfeit $20 bill.  So they were both waiting for EMS assistance and presumably wanting George Floyd to calm down.  I would hope that they would check to see if George Floyd had acquired this fake $20 and used it innocently or that he was part of some criminal counterfeit money enterprise or scheme.  It seemed like George Floyd was presumed guilty or he was being handcuffed for being in a driver's seat while intoxicated. ,0.28,0.0,0.04,0.0,0.07,0.0

And for that matter, don't take cocaine and meth your whole life, it's really bad for your heart. And don't take 3x the lethal dose of fentanyl. All of this will ensure you have a massive heart attack if you ever become excited. In fact he was probably already having a heart attack when the cops got there, which explains why he was sitting in his car so long and had to sit at the side of the road after he was removed from the car. Also, don't drive while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, you will probably end up killing someone. Finally, if the cops arrest you, don't resist arrest.

When those policemen initially put Floyd in handcuffs they should have put him into the police car and taken him to the police station where they should've then put him into a cell and begin the process of booking an arrest and giving Floyd his due process. Just like they did for Ted Bundy and all the other much horrible people than Floyd. Once an individual is placed in handcuffs any life or death threat to the police is eliminated. So the fact that some people think Floyd was crying wolf is irrelevant because by then the police were already recklessly detaining him.  I don't know when and why police started to recklessly detain people for crimes who then end up dead at the hands of the pigs but it has got to end.,2.32,0.01,0.42,0.0,0.4,0.03

  I just love how you emphasize the color of the officer and victim to cause more racial tension in the US so you have more crap to write about for ratings and views to make money off of, ""A Black man killed by a White officer"" but yet the video of the Dallas store owner being beaten damn near to death you stated as ""Dallas Store owner assaulted by rioters"" why didnt you state it as their ethnicities as shown in the video like you did in Floyd's video???, why not ""White Dallas business owner beaten almost to death by Black rioters""? Wich you can clearly see in that video.... I'll tell you why!, Because history has proven that Caucasians will not root and loot over this kind of thing when Black ethnicities will...you simply stated it as a race issue in Floyd's death in Hope's of rioting and uproar like other media circuses did aswell hoping to televise and cover the riots to get ratings and make money!

George Floyd was moving still when they layed the stretcher down on the ground then he went limp. The time lasp does not drive with the stretcher on the ground espeacilly if George Floyd was still moving? Why would they call paramedics for a conscious person? Just wanted to know if anyone else saw the unedited video by the young lady. Why has it been removed from you tube? Every video on YouTube now of George Floyd has been edited cut and pasted. Weird? Was it scripted? False Flag? Why was George Floyd's autopsy done by the same person who did JFKs autopsy? Dr. Michael Baden is 86 yr old. Isnt there any other pathologist i just figure the guy would be retired chilling and relaxing. Why him? How did they know it was going to be a high profile case? Was it planned before hand?

But what does race have to do with it? There are no apparent facts that the police officer on Floyd's neck isn’t anybody but just another violent person who may very well beat on his wife or girlfriend, regardless of color. George has a long criminal récord. At one point he barged into a pregnant woman's home with a gun, impersonating a government worker. There were four or five men shaking this poor woman down whilst George had a gun shoved into her stomach. He pleaded guilty and spent several years in prison. George Floyd did not deserve to die but he is being portrayed as a petty criminal and he was a violent man, most likely as is the man who caused his death. And how many violent crimes had he gotten away with? I certainly believe peaceful protests have their place. They need permits so crowd control can be planned. However, taking personal outrage to the streets, looting stores for personal gain, damaging property, inciting violent riots, should not be condoned.
