      "Second: The FED just as any other central banks are creating money outta thin air. It's not backed by any hard asset or anything whatsoever! 1 Trillion dollars is just 13 keystrokes on a computer, nothing else! This is the FIAT monetary system. By creating additional money supply  they are increasing the amount of money(M1,M2) circulating in the system. By definition this is inflation. If they would stop their won't be inflation or asset price inflation. Like doubling housing prices. Now you have to work 20 years more to buy the same apartment that you could have bought 10 years ago for half the price. Proof of money printing? Go to the Federal Reserve's website. Check their balance sheet. All central banks are doing the same. What I meant to say with this is that is very awkward that people want to defend something what only a selected few individuals can do to the benefit of their shareholders because those dollars are created into existence with interest! So you people have to pay interest on the newly printed dollars to the FED which is a private bank with private owners that actually nobody knows. It is not federal! The main thing is that we are all going to witness a great reset. Debt will never be paid back. Maybe inflated into nothing and we savers are going to suffer from it!\n",

I realize this hold should not have been used, but the knee hold alone should not have killed him, he had harmful drugs in his system and possibly a bad heart when this happened, like when police use a taser to subdue someone it is suppose to knock someone out but if you have a bad heart it has been fatal at times.

How I interpret it is that (after reading the transcript released today) he is terrified of being shot and killed by the cops so of course, he doesn't want to go with them. Whatever he'd allegedly done, that is no reason for the death sentence he was given. I could never imagine this occurring in my country (again, I only have the experience as a white woman here in Aus). One big factor I see is that cops are scared of people having guns, so they operate intensely, even when there may be no justification for it. Also, it seems these officers have no idea how to deal with mental illness or drug inebriated cases. From my perspective in Aus, looking at a country that most of the time we take leadership points from, America has lost all sense of reason, morality and common sense.\n",

The original clips I seen which are not shown  have all been taken down. I check my YT history and they are taken down. I watched this whole video and still the few key clips I seen when this all started are missing.  The cop was wrong, but there are some clips missing that showed resistance. Not sure why they are trying to hide the fact he resisted. It don't change the fact the cop took it too far.\n",

When the store owners approach you and ask for the cigarettes back, be humble and admit you've been caught and hand them over. Don't smoke, it's bad for your heart. And for that matter, don't take cocaine and meth your whole life, it's really bad for your heart. And don't take 3x the lethal dose of fentanyl. All of this will ensure you have a massive heart attack if you ever become excited. In fact he was probably already having a heart attack when the cops got there, which explains why he was sitting in his car so long and had to sit at the side of the road after he was removed from the car. Also, don't drive while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, you will probably end up killing someone. Finally, if the cops arrest you, don't resist arrest. All the bad choices you made in your life have led you to this point. Take responsibility for those choices.\n",

So the fact that some people think Floyd was crying wolf is irrelevant because by then the police were already recklessly detaining him.

Wich you can clearly see in that video.... I'll tell you why!, Because history has proven that Caucasians will not root and loot over this kind of thing when Black ethnicities will...you simply stated it as a race issue in Floyd's death in Hope's of rioting and uproar like other media circuses did aswell hoping to televise and cover the riots to get ratings and make money! \n",

I walked up to my brother and bent down and asked him what kind of cop he was gonna be and his response made me cry. he told me he was gonna help those in need and make sure everyone is safe, he told me that he was gonna protect his family and friends and he was gonna help anyone who needed it. to this day i am very unhappy with the police force and how in my city 57 ETF officers quit because of 2 of the ETF members pushed an old man to the ground and were fired for almost killing the man. those 52 ETF members quit only because the 'action' of the captain was 'unfair'\n",

Just wanted to know if anyone else saw the unedited video by the young lady. Why has it been removed from you tube? Every video on YouTube now of George Floyd has been edited cut and pasted. Weird? Was it scripted? False Flag? Why was George Floyd's autopsy done by the same person who did JFKs autopsy? Dr. Michael Baden is 86 yr old. Isnt there any other pathologist i just figure the guy would be retired chilling and relaxing. Why him? How did they know it was going to be a high profile case? Was it planned before hand? It doesnt make sense. To much missing pieces of the puzzle. Hmmmm?\n",

Pray for those like this cop because there’s something deeper and it’s an issue of the heart. Pray for change in this world and keep it peaceful. Don’t give them a reason to harm you, please. 💔 Stand up in peace and love, leave the rest to God. God bless you all, I really hope and pray that hearts are changed and come to salvation in Jesus through this. That’s what we need is to love like Jesus and it starts within each of us first, but, we have to be willing to allow the Holy Spirit to work in our hearts by accepting Jesus and repenting ❤️\n",

      "Excellent! The Post made a laudable effort to reconstruct the facts. The autopsy revealed that George Floyd was high on fentanyl and methamphetamine. The meth is known to cause aggression. He may have been very well have been fighting with the police. I have no way of knowing but excessive force appears to have been used, The other cops should have intervened but didn’t. But what does race have to do with it? There are no apparent facts that the police officer on Floyd's neck isn’t anybody but just another violent person who may very well beat on his wife or girlfriend, regardless of color. George has a long criminal récord. At one point he barged into a pregnant woman's home with a gun, impersonating a government worker. There were four or five men shaking this poor woman down whilst George had a gun shoved into her stomach. He pleaded guilty and spent several years in prison. George Floyd did not deserve to die but he is being portrayed as a petty criminal and he was a violent man, most likely as is the man who caused his death. And how many violent crimes had he gotten away with? I certainly believe peaceful protests have their place. They need permits so crowd control can be planned. However, taking personal outrage to the streets, looting stores for personal gain, damaging property, inciting violent riots, should not be condoned. Many, many people have suffered as a result.\n",
